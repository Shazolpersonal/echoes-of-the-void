## 🏆 Hackathon Tracks

This project targets three Kiroween Hackathon tracks:

### 🧟 Resurrection
Bringing back the classic text adventure genre! Echoes of the Void resurrects the spirit of Zork and Colossal Cave Adventure, combining 80s interactive fiction with modern AI to create infinitely replayable horror experiences.

### 🎭 Costume Contest
The immersive **CRT/Terminal UI** transforms your browser into a haunted 1980s computer terminal, complete with:
- Phosphor green text glow
- Authentic scanline effects
- Screen flicker and distortion
- Retro ASCII art rendering

### 💀 Skeleton Crew
The **adaptable architecture** allows developers to instantly transform this horror game into any genre by simply modifying the system prompt. One engine, infinite possibilities.

---

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Read the narrative** - The AI Dungeon Master describes your surroundings
2. **Type commands** - Enter actions like `look around`, `go north`, `take torch`, `attack creature`
3. **Watch your health** - Your sanity degrades as you encounter horrors. Reach 0 and it's game over.
4. **Find items** - Collect useful items to aid your survival
5. **Survive** - Escape The Void... if you can.

### 💡 Tips
- The Void punishes reckless behavior - think before you act
- Items found early can save your life later
- Some horrors are best avoided, not confronted

## 💀 Skeleton Crew Guide

**Want to create your own adventure?** The entire game's theme, tone, and world can be changed by modifying a single file!

### Transforming the Game

Open `src/lib/prompts.ts` and modify the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant:

```typescript
// Current: Dark Horror in The Void
export const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are the Dungeon Master for "Echoes of the Void," 
a dark horror text adventure set in an abandoned underground complex...`

// Transform to: Sci-Fi Space Adventure
export const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are the Ship AI for "Stellar Odyssey," 
a sci-fi text adventure set aboard a derelict space station...`

// Transform to: Fantasy Quest
export const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are the Narrator for "Realm of Shadows," 
a high fantasy text adventure in a magical kingdom...`
```

### What You Can Customize

| Element | How to Change |
|---------|---------------|
| **Genre** | Modify the setting description (horror → sci-fi → fantasy) |
| **Tone** | Adjust the writing style instructions |
| **World Rules** | Define new mechanics (magic system, technology, etc.) |
| **Health System** | Rename "sanity" to "oxygen", "mana", or "stamina" |
| **Items** | Change early reward items to match your theme |

The game engine handles everything else automatically - AI responses, state management, UI, and sound cues all adapt to your new world!
